# Procedure Automation

Platform for our ACL 2024 Paper "[CARE: A Clue-guided Assistant for CSRs to Read User Manuals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03633)"

## Why Procedure Automation ?
It is time-saving to build a platform for users when dealing with procedural documents, especially information-rich ones. We propose to develop a time-saving and careful platform for users who need to read, understand and apply procedural documents, which can help them quickly find desired information via explicit clue chains. Specifically, each of the clue chains is formed by inferring over the procedural documents, starting from the node aligned with the user question and ending at a possible response.

## Code
The platform will be released soon ...
